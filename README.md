# Object-Detection
a computer vision project about detecting “winking” and the “silence” (shush) expression

Created by Xiangru Zhou

This project is written by C++ with OpenCV library.

***********************************
Project Requirement:

In this project you are asked to create programs to detect “winking” and the “silence” (shush) expression. 

In writing your programs you may use all the high level functionality of OpenCV, but you are not allowed to convert images into arrays of pixel values. 

The only cascade classifiers that can be used are those provided by OpenCV, as well as those available in the following link:
http://alereimondo.no-ip.org/OpenCV/34.

In both cases the input to the program is a folder containing images or a live video feed. The program displays each image, and marks each detected face with a distinct color.

Part I: Wink detection

    Write an OpenCV program that can detect a winking face.

Part II: Silence (shush) Detection

    Write an OpenCV program that can detect a “shush” expression. (This is when a person requests silence by raising the index finger vertical to the lips.)
